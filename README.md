Welcome to my "Choose Your Own Adventure" game!

During the software development intro course, we created a simple JavaScript game. Taking what we learned from the intro, I had created my own game with a better UI.

Original JS Game:

My Version of the JS Game:

To make the UI/UX even easier, I used Web Dev Simplified's video on YouTube to create the buttons.

Instructions:

1. Read the initial prompt
2. Click the button that best describes your personal decisions.
3. Continue through the game and read along the prompts until the end.
4. You can restart the game and try different decisions!

I hope you enjoy. Have fun!
